# Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

# You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
# Output: 2
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
# Output: 1
# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
# Output: 4
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 104
# -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
# nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
# -104 <= target <= 104

# SECOND ATTEMPT
# O(logn)
