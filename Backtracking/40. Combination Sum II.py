# Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to target.

# Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.

# Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8
# Output: 
# [
# [1,1,6],
# [1,2,5],
# [1,7],
# [2,6]
# ]
# Example 2:

# Input: candidates = [2,5,2,1,2], target = 5
# Output: 
# [
# [1,2,2],
# [5]
# ]
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= candidates.length <= 100
# 1 <= candidates[i] <= 50
# 1 <= target <= 30

# time limit exceeded on large test cases like 100 candidates with value 1 and target 30
# O(2^n) time complexity in the worst case, where n is the number of candidates. This is because, in the worst case, we may explore all possible combinations of candidates.

                # but we don't ignore the first one (default one), then we cna cover all the cases and we only need 101 branches
                # prunes the tree by skipping over duplicate candidates at the same recursive depth
