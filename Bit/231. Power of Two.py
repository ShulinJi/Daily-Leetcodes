# Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

# An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 1
# Output: true
# Explanation: 20 = 1
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 16
# Output: true
# Explanation: 24 = 16
# Example 3:

# Input: n = 3
# Output: false
 

# Constraints:

# -231 <= n <= 231 - 1
 

# Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

        # and only the number that is power of 2 will result in flipping all bits to 1 except the lowest set bit 0000100 => 1111100)
        # thus, n & -n will give us the value of the lowest set bit, 0000100 and 1111100 will result in 0000100, which is equal to n itself
        # this means that if n is a power of two, n & -n will equal n itself
