# Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
# Output: 10
# Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
# The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
# Example 2:


# Input: heights = [2,4]
# Output: 4
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= heights.length <= 105
# 0 <= heights[i] <= 104

# O(n^2) time complexity, where n is the number of bars in the histogram. This is because we have a nested loop: for each bar, we potentially look at all other bars to its right to determine the minimum height and calculate the area.
# brute force approach by examining all possible rectangles

# O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of bars in the histogram. Each bar is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.

            # which means we found the right limit for the popped height, and left limit is the new top of the stack after popping
            # since new top of the stack after popping is the first height smaller than the popped height

                # right limit - left limit - 1 is the width, use -1 becuase we want to exclude the left limit and right limit, ex left=2, right=4, then 
                # width = 4 - 2 - 1 = 1, which is the index of the bar between left and right
                current_width = i - stack[-1] - 1

            stack.append(i)

        # after iterating through all heights, we may still have some heights in the stack
        # which means they don't have a right limit, so we can use the length of heights as the right limit
        while stack[-1] != -1:
            current_height = heights[stack.pop()]
            # use right most boundary as right limit since all elements left in the stack are the ones couldn't find 
            # smaller heights than them, which means it is min height after its index
