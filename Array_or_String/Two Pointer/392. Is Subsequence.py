# Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
# A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: true
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: false

# Constraints:
# 0 <= s.length <= 100
# 0 <= t.length <= 104
# s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
# Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, 
# and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?



# Two Pointers
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        # get the bound for s and t (the bound which the pointer would stop at)
        leftBound = len(s)
        rightBound = len(t)

        # we will slide our pointer whenever we find there is a match for left and right
        # This ensures the order since we slide from left to right
        left = 0
        right = 0
        while left < leftBound and right < rightBound:
            if s[left] == t[right]:
                left += 1
            right += 1

        # then we only need to check if the pointer has travelled through all s, meaning that all characters in s have been found in t
        # which implies that s is a subsequence of t
        return left == leftBound
