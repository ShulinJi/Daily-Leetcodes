# You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.

# Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

# For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
# Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

# A leaf node is a node with no children.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: root = [1,2,3]
# Output: 25
# Explanation:
# The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
# The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
# Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
# Example 2:


# Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
# Output: 1026
# Explanation:
# The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
# The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
# The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
# Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
# 0 <= Node.val <= 9
# The depth of the tree will not exceed 10.
