# You are given two lists of closed intervals, firstList and secondList, where firstList[i] = [starti, endi] and secondList[j] = [startj, endj]. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

# Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

# A closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.

# The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].

 

# Example 1:


# Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
# Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
# Example 2:

# Input: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = []
# Output: []
