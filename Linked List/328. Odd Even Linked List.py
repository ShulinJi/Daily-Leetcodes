# Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

# The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

# Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

# You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
# Example 2:


# Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
# Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range [0, 104].
# -106 <= Node.val <= 106


# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if head is None or head.next is None:
            return head
        
        # create 2 heads for odd and even numebers
        oddHead, odd = head, head
        evenHead, even = head.next, head.next

        # keep traversal, the next node of even is odd, the next node of odd is even
        while even and even.next:
            odd.next = even.next
            odd = odd.next
            even.next = odd.next
            even = even.next
        
        # after the traversal, we attach the even list to the odd list
        odd.next = evenHead

        return head
