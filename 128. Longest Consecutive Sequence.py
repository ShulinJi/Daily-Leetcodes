# Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
# Output: 9
